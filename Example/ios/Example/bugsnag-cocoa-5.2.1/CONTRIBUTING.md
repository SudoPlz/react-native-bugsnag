Running the tests
-----------------

Run the tests using the default SDK (iOS 9.2) by using:

    make test

Alternately, you can specify an iOS SDK:

    make SDK=iphonesimulator8.1 test

Or test on OS X:

    make BUILD_OSX=1 test

If you are interested in cleaner formatting, run `make bootstrap` to install
[xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty) as an output formatter.
